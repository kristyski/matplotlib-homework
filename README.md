1. When reviewing the Summary Statistics table, and the bar charts, the two drugs "Capomulin" and "Ramicane" have the lowest average tumor volume over the entire data set and also have the greatest number of treatment timepoints.

2. When reviewing the drug "Capomulin," I believe that because it has the lowest inner quartile range of the four most promising drugs, this supports the idea that it has the most consistent data.

3. On the linear regression model, there appears to be a correlation between the weight of the subject and their tumor volume.
